    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Chicken stir-fry is a quick and flavorful dish made by cooking bite-sized pieces of chicken in a 
            hot pan with colorful vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, and onions. The chicken is 
            sautéed until golden and tender, then tossed with the vegetables in a savory sauce made 
            from soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and a hint of sweetness. The stir-fry is cooked at high heat 
            to retain the crunchiness of the vegetables while ensuring the chicken is juicy and full of flavor. 
            This versatile dish can be served over rice or noodles for a satisfying, balanced meal.
