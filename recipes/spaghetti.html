    <div class="description">
        <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a simple, yet flavorful Italian pasta dish made with just a few key ingredients: 
            spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and fresh parsley. The garlic is gently sautéed in olive 
            oil until golden, releasing its rich aroma. Red pepper flakes add a hint of spice, while the pasta is tossed 
            in the infused oil for a silky, savory finish. A sprinkle of fresh parsley adds a touch of brightness. 
            This quick, satisfying dish highlights the beauty of minimalist cooking, with a perfect balance of heat, 
            garlic, and olive oil.

             <p>
                &#x2022; Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                &#x2022; Add the sliced garlic to the pan and sauté gently until golden brown and fragrant (about 2-3 minutes), being careful not to burn the garlic.

            <p>
                &#x2022; Add the cooked pasta to the pan with the garlic oil, tossing to coat evenly. Add some reserved pasta water to achieve a silky sauce.
