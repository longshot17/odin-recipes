        <p>Avocado toast is a simple, yet satisfying dish featuring ripe avocado spread over toasted bread. 
            The creamy avocado is often seasoned with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil, with optional toppings 
            like a squeeze of lemon, red pepper flakes, or a poached egg. The combination of crispy toast and smooth, 
            flavorful avocado makes for a nutritious and delicious meal or snack. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or 
            anytime you need a quick, wholesome bite.
